## Forward Voltage
**Forward voltage** is the minimum voltage needed to allow the flow of current.

--- 

#### Higher-frequency light (blue, green) corresponds to higher-energy photons. 
A larger forward voltage is needed to emit these higher-energy photons.

#### Lower-frequency light (red, yellow) corresponds to lower-energy photons. 
A smaller forward voltage is needed to emit these lower-energy photons.

## Wavelength and Forward Voltage Correlation


## Amperage
In **Parallel Circuits**, each branch recieves voltage equal to the power source. Since the power source is a 9V battery, each branch recieves 9V minus the forward voltage of the LED.

Using the voltage of each branch and resistance of each branch (1000 Ω), the current can be determined using **Ohms Law (I = V/R).**

#### Measured Current of each branch
* Red = 7.2 mA
* Yellow = 7 mA
* Green = 6.5 mA
* Blue = 6.2 mA

Each LED is rated at 20 mA, so all the measured currents are within a safe range.



## Conclusion
This experiment demonstrated that as the LED's color frequency increased, the forward voltage increased. It also demostrated that in parallel wiring, each branch recieves the same source voltage with differing current based on voltage drops and resistance.
