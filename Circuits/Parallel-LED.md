# Parallel LED Circuit
Simple parallel LED circuit designed to demostrate that voltage is maintained amongst branches, while current is divided. 

## Setup
4 small LEDS rated for 0.02A
9 Volt Battery
4 1000 Ohm resistors

Small LEDS have an Amp rating of 0.02A. Given parallel circuits maintain a uniform voltage amongst all branches, I used 1000 ohm resistors on each branch to drop the amperage to 0.009A. This allowed the LEDS to function without burning out.
