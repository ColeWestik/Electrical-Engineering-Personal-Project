# Parallel LED Circuit
This is a simple Parallel Circuit using 4 LEDS, 4 Resistors, and a 9 Volt battery.

Since it was my first circuit, It was not the neatest circuit, though it was fully functioning.

Small LEDS have an Amp rating of 0.02A. Given parallel circuits maintain a uniform voltage amongst all branches, I used 1000 ohm resistors on each branch to drop the amperage to 0.009A. This allowed the LEDS to function without burning out.
