# Parallel LED Circuit and Forward Voltage
Using a multimeter, determined the forward voltage of different colored LEDS. Then, using that information, determined the amperage of each branch in a parallel circuit. Simple parallel LED circuit designed to demostrate that voltage is maintained amongst branches, while current is divided. 

## Setup
* 4 small LEDS rated for 0.02A
* 9 Volt Battery
* 4 1000 Ohm resistors

## Forward Voltage
* Higher-frequency light (blue, green) corresponds to higher-energy photons. A larger forward voltage is needed to emit these higher-energy photons.

* Lower-frequency light (red, yellow) corresponds to lower-energy photons. A smaller forward voltage is needed to emit these lower-energy photons.
