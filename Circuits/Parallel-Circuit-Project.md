# Parallel LED Circuit and Forward Voltage
This project explores forward voltage and the functionality of parallel circuits.

## Setup
* 4 small LEDS rated at 0.02A
* 9V Battery
* 4 x 1000Ω resistors

## Forward Voltage
#### Forward voltage is the minimum voltage needed to begin the flow of current.



#### Higher-frequency light (blue, green) corresponds to higher-energy photons. A larger forward voltage is needed to emit these higher-energy photons.

#### Lower-frequency light (red, yellow) corresponds to lower-energy photons. A smaller forward voltage is needed to emit these lower-energy photons.

#### I measured the following forward voltages
* Red ≈ 1.9V
* Yellow ≈ 2V
* Green ≈ 2.5V
* Blue ≈ 2.8V

## Calculations
Given that parallel circuits have a uniform voltage amongst branches, the amperage of each branch depended on the forward Voltage of each LED, along with the resistor.
