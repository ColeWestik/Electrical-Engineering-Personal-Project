# Parallel LED Circuit and Forward Voltage
This project was used to explore Forward Voltage and the functionality of Parallel Circuits.

## Setup
* 4 small LEDS rated for 0.02A
* 9 Volt Battery
* 4 1000 Ohm resistors

## Forward Voltage
### Higher-frequency light (blue, green) corresponds to higher-energy photons. A larger forward voltage is needed to emit these higher-energy photons.

### Lower-frequency light (red, yellow) corresponds to lower-energy photons. A smaller forward voltage is needed to emit these lower-energy photons.

First, I used a multimeter to find the Forward Voltage of different colored LEDS.
